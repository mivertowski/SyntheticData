## HR and Payroll Integration (v0.6.0)

Employee master data serves as the foundation for the `hr` configuration section introduced in v0.6.0. When the HR module is enabled, each employee record drives downstream generation:

- **Payroll**: Salary, tax withholdings, benefits deductions, and retirement contributions are computed per employee based on their role and the salary ranges defined in `hr.payroll.salary_ranges`. The `pay_frequency` setting (monthly, biweekly, or weekly) determines how many payroll runs are generated per period.
- **Time and Attendance**: Time entries are generated for each employee according to working days in the period. The `overtime_rate` controls how many employees have overtime hours in a given period.
- **Expense Reports**: A subset of employees (controlled by `hr.expenses.submission_rate`) generate expense reports each month. Policy violations are injected at the configured `policy_violation_rate`.

The `employees.count` and `employees.hierarchy_depth` settings in `master_data` directly determine the population size for all HR outputs. Increasing the employee count will proportionally increase payroll journal entries, time records, and expense reports.

```yaml
master_data:
  employees:
    count: 200                     # Drives payroll and HR volume
    hierarchy_depth: 5

hr:
  enabled: true                    # Activates payroll, time, and expenses
  payroll:
    pay_frequency: "biweekly"      # 26 pay periods per year
  expenses:
    submission_rate: 0.40          # 40% of employees submit per month
```

## Examples

### Small Company

```yaml
master_data:
  vendors:
    count: 50
  customers:
    count: 100
  materials:
    count: 200
  fixed_assets:
    count: 20
  employees:
    count: 10
    hierarchy_depth: 2
```

### Large Enterprise

```yaml
master_data:
  vendors:
    count: 2000
    intercompany_ratio: 0.1
  customers:
    count: 10000
    intercompany_ratio: 0.1
  materials:
    count: 50000
  fixed_assets:
    count: 5000
  employees:
    count: 500
    hierarchy_depth: 8
```

## Validation

| Check | Rule |
|-------|------|
| `count` | > 0 |
| `intercompany_ratio` | 0.0 - 1.0 |
| `hierarchy_depth` | ≥ 1 |
| Distribution weights | Sum = 1.0 |
