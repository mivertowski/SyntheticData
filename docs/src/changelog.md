## Recent Releases

### [0.9.3] - 2026-02-27

**Community Features & Edge-Case Hardening**

- **VAT line splitting in O2C/P2P journal entries** ([#64](https://github.com/DataSynth/SyntheticData/issues/64)): Customer Invoice JE now correctly posts DR AR (gross), CR Revenue (net), CR VAT Payable (tax); Vendor Invoice JE posts DR GR/IR (net), DR Input VAT (tax), CR AP (payable)
- **Multipayment behavior** ([#65](https://github.com/DataSynth/SyntheticData/issues/65)): O2C/P2P partial payments now generate remainder payments with configurable timing, full JE generation, and cash flow integration
- **Account-class fingerprinting** ([#66](https://github.com/DataSynth/SyntheticData/issues/66)): Per-account-class statistics extraction with semantic column detection, per-class Benford analysis, and distribution fitting for synthesis
- Division-by-zero guards in fingerprint k-anonymity and federated aggregation
- Graph ghost edge elimination (skip missing nodes instead of remapping to node 0)
- GoBD safe document ID truncation, Prometheus/rate-limit unwrap removal
- Deterministic household UUIDs, config-driven P2P/O2C rates
- NaN guards in distribution fitter and mixture samplers
- Dead code removal (3 structs, 2 fields, 1 variable)
- Improved error logging across 12 crates (serialization, parsing, configuration)

### [0.9.2] - 2026-02-27

- Constant-time gRPC auth token comparison (`subtle::ConstantTimeEq`)
- Fixed employee generator `last_mut()` ordering, banking RNG determinism, CLI verify count mismatch, DGL node types
- Neo4j/DGL graph exports wired in orchestrator; server stream/reload/proto stubs implemented
- GoBD tax amount and contra account improvements for multi-line entries
- Config validation: start_date format, company name/country, safety limit warnings
- Production unwrap/expect calls replaced with descriptive errors across 6 crates
- Shared NPY writer extraction; proper Beta distribution; improved A-D p-value and AML detectability

### [0.9.1] - 2026-02-26

**Generalized Multi-GAAP Framework + German GAAP (HGB)**

- German GAAP (HGB) framework: SKR04 chart of accounts, Degressiv depreciation, GWG low-value asset expensing, BMF lease classification, mandatory impairment reversal
- Generalized `FrameworkAccounts` mapping ~45 semantic accounts per framework (US GAAP, French PCG, German SKR04)
- GoBD audit export (13-column journal CSV + account CSV + XML index)
- Auxiliary GL sub-accounts on vendor/customer master data (PCG `401XXXX`/`411XXXX`, SKR04 `3300XXXX`/`1200XXXX`)
- FEC auxiliary fields now use framework-specific GL accounts instead of raw partner IDs
- Expanded French PCG account modules (fixed assets, tax, suspense, equity, liabilities)
